#summary How to prepare data to visualize in JFlowMap.

= How to prepare data for JFlowMap =

A very short description for now.

To load a dataset in a specific view (flowmap or flowstrates) you need to create a view configuration file (a .jfmv file). You can find a few examples of them in the 'viewconf' folder of the demo. They are simple text files, readable and easy to change. For instance, both of the refugee .jfmv files load data from CSV files. The nodes (countries, in this case) are in 'data/refugee-nodes.csv.gz', the flows - in 'data/refugee-flows.csv.gz'. If you unzip the .csv.gz files, you'll see how they are organized, so that you can prepare your data as CSV in the same way. Then you can run the application as described in the README file.

Otherwise, if you have an interesting OD-dataset and need help visualizing it, just [mailto:ilya.boyandin@unifr.ch send me an email].

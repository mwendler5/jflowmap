Flowstrates is a novel interactive visualization approach which extends the idea of a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_map flow map] (showing magnitudes of the flows of entities between geographic locations on a map) to the temporal dimension and allows to analyze the temporal changes of the flow magnitudes. In Flowstrates the origins and the destinations of the flows are displayed in two separate maps, and the changes over time of the flow magnitudes are visualized in a separate heatmap view in the middle.

As in most flow maps, in Flowstrates we also do not show the exact flow paths (they are usually not even known in origin-destination datasets), therefore we can reroute the flow lines in any way. So we represent the temporal information in an
abstract view (a heatmap in which the columns correspond
to different time periods) and draw the flow lines so that
they connect the flow origins and destinations with the corresponding rows of the heatmap, as if the flows were going
through it.


Flowstrates are meant for interactive exploration. Unlike
[http://people.hofstra.edu/geotrans/eng/ch5en/meth5en/odmatrix.html OD-matrices] which represent exactly one flow in each
heatmap cell, in Flowstrates every flow takes the whole row
of the heatmap. Thus, much more screen real estate is used
to represent the same number of flows. Hence, for many
datasets it is impossible to display all the flows simultaneously
without filtering or aggregating them. If we want the
analysts to still be able to explore the data in every bit of
detail, then we need to provide means of interaction. Currently, our
implementation supports the following interaction techniques:

 * Visual querying and filtering
 * Zooming and panning
 * Heatmap row ordering
 * Heatmap row aggregation




Here is a short video which can give you an impression of how Flowstrates can be used:

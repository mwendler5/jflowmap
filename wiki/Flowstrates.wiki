#summary Visual exploration of temporal origin-destination data with  Flowstrates

= Flowstrates =
Flowstrates is a new interactive visualization approach which we developed for representing magnitudes of the flows of entities between geographic locations and their changes over time. In Flowstrates the origins and the destinations of the flows are displayed in two separate maps, and the changes over time of the flow magnitudes are represented in a separate heatmap view in the middle.

This allows the users to perform spatial visual queries, focusing on different regions of interest for the origins
and destinations, and to analyze the changes over time provided with the means of flow ordering, filtering and aggregation in the heatmap.

As it is not necessary to show the exact flow paths (they are usually not even known in origin-destination datasets), we can reroute the flow lines in any way. So we represent the temporal information in an
abstract view (a heatmap in which the columns correspond
to different time periods) and draw the flow lines so that
they connect the flow origins and destinations with the corresponding rows of the heatmap, as if the flows were going
through it.


= Why maps? =
Maps are well familiar to everybody. They
allow to reason about the geographic patterns of the movement
as no other representation by naturally providing answers
to questions such as: “What is the spatial distribution
of the locations?”, “How far are they from each other?”,
